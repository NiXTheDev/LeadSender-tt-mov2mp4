# Project requirements

- ffmpeg to be installed and accesible via PATH or FFMPEG_PATH environment variable
- node to be installed, of version 22.13 or newer

## Steps for running the project locally

1. Install the dependencies with `npm ci`
2. Start the server with `node app.js`

That's it! Now you can access the server at `http://localhost:8080/`

## Post Scriptum

Demo is also available at [mov2mp4](https://nix.mercusysddns.com/api/mov2mp4) until the end of the month(Feb 28 2025)
(Demo server limits uploads to ~2GB as to not be overwhelmed, it's running on a raspberry pi afterall)
